# When pip installs anything from packages, py_modules, or ext_modules that
# includes a twistd plugin (which are installed to twisted/plugins/),
# setuptools/distribute writes a Package.egg-info/top_level.txt that includes
# "twisted".  If you later uninstall Package with `pip uninstall Package`,
# pip removes all of twisted/ instead of just Package's twistd plugins.  See
# https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/355
#
# To work around this problem, we monkeypatch
# setuptools.command.egg_info.write_toplevel_names to not write the line
# "twisted".  This fixes the behavior of `pip uninstall Package`.  Note that
# even with this workaround, `pip uninstall Package` still correctly uninstalls
# Package's twistd plugins from twisted/plugins/, since pip also uses
# Package.egg-info/installed-files.txt to determine what to uninstall,
# and the paths to the plugin files are indeed listed in installed-files.txt.
